Intro
=====

Several browsers (FF 3.5 and MobileSafari) support the new W3C browser stanard to do
geolocation (http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html). This will work on desktop browsers as well as 
mobile browsers to determine a user's location.

The idea here is for a simple page that determines your location and
provides 1-click access to local services (weather, human readable location, yelp, ATMs, starbucks, etc.) either
as a link or a mashup using an API.
